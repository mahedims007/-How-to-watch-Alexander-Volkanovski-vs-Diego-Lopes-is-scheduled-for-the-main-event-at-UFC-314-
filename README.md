This is a big matchup for both fighters, who Volkanovski is trying to regain his old form while Lopes is seeking his first UFC title.
Alexander Volkanovski's Story
Record and Recent Form: Volkanovski (26-4) is a former UFC featherweight champion who held the belt for more than four years, during which he defended it five times. But he’s coming off consecutive knockout defeats — first at lightweight to Islam Makhachev in October 2024, then at featherweight to Ilia Topuria in February 2024. It will be his first fight in more than a year after a 14-month recovery.
Motivation: Volkanovski, 36, said he knew that this could be his final opportunity to win back the title. He has adopted an “Old Man Volk” identity, trying to show he’s capable of competing at the highest level. He is confident that with experience and tactical acumen he can outlast younger opponents.
Diego Lopes' Rise
Record and Momentum: Lopes (26-6) is on a five-fight winning streak, with wins over Dan Ige and Brian Ortega. Lopes is a dangerous finisher who became known for his aggressive style and knockout power, and he has stormed his way up the featherweight ranks just 18 months after his UFC debut.
Fighting Style: Lopes has the striking power to knock out an opponent, yet he is equally dangerous on the ground owing to his elite jiu-jitsu capabilities. But questions about his cardio remain, though he has improved in recent fights.
Keys to Victory
For Volkanovski: The experts say that Volkanovski should use his footwork and tactical approach to grind Lopes cardio down. Avoiding early exchanges where Lopes is at his most dangerous will be critical too. Volkanovski’s durability has been questioned since back-to-back knockout defeats.
For Lopes: Lopes needs to take advantage of Volkanovski’s recent struggles by applying pressure from the start and relying on his power. His style of blending striking with grappling could also be a headache for Volkanovski.
